Brief Introduction About Myself

Hi, my name is Precious, but I prefer to be called Black. I am currently studying Software Engineering and I enjoy building creative and practical solutions using technology. I love learning new tools that help me grow as a developer, especially because I’m still exploring the tech space and figuring out my strengths.

I would describe myself as curious, thoughtful, and driven. I like solving problems and discovering how things work behind the scenes. Outside academics, I enjoy designing handmade accessories, reading, and learning new skills that help me grow personally and professionally.
