One thing I have learned so far in this course is how version control works, especially using Git and GitHub. I now understand how repositories are created, how files are tracked, and how commits help record changes. I also learned how branching supports experimentation without affecting the main code, and how pull requests allow collaboration between contributors. Overall, this course has helped me gain confidence working with Git tools to manage projects properly.
